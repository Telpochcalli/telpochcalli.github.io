                <h2 class="fw-300">Steps for joining</h2>

                <p>Joining a new team might be difficult, but we tried to make it as easy as possible. This are the steps that you will need to follow:</p>

                <h4>Step 1: getting to know where you want to join</h4>

                <p>Knowing what you want to do inside the team is critical. As a working robotics team, we are divided into the following sections:</p>

You do not need to be an expert, but have a little of the following requirements, if you don't know anything about that, you can still go though out interview, and if you have other aptitudes we like about you, we will certainly let you in!</p>

Part of your actions will be talking to possible sponsors, managing social media, marketing the team and making strategies.</p>

                <ul>
